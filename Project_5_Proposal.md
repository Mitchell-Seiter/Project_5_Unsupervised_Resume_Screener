Dear Rocky Mountain Recruiting Firm,

Thanks for reaching out! It is my understanding you are wanting to have a resume filtering algorithm built to more easily screen job candidates, and to help place candidates for certain fields easier. 

Since you primarily screen for data science candidates, that will be what I focus on, but if there is more time I can try to expand it to include other fields of work as well. Using this dataset of ~1000 resumes I should be able to build a model that can predict if an applicant is a good fit for a certain field of work. 

I will break down each resume by individual keywords words and sections and then start to construct an algorithm that will determine if the applicant is qualified for a data science type job, or some other field of work. For reference this will be done in Python using the following tools NLTK, spaCy, gensim, and scikit-learn. 

By next Monday I hope to provide you with a MVP which will contain some topic models and some cleaned up text preprocessing which will break down the resumes. 

Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. 

Kind regards,
Mitchell C. Seiter
